Lab 1

1. Palindrome Checker

Write a program that:

- Takes a string as input.
- Uses a loop to check if the string is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).
- Ignores spaces, punctuation, and case sensitivity.


2. Array Reversal

Write a program that:

- Takes an integer n as input, followed by n integers to store in an array.
- Reverses the array in place (without using an additional array).
- Prints the reversed array.


3. String Compression

Write a program that:

- Takes a string as input.
- Compresses the string by replacing consecutive occurrences of the same character with the character followed by the number of repetitions (e.g., "aaabbcc" becomes "a3b2c2").


4. Find Second Largest Element

Write a program that:

- Takes an integer n as input, followed by n integers to store in an array.
- Finds the second largest element in the array without sorting it.
- Handles cases where all elements are the same or there are fewer than two distinct elements.


5. Longest Common Prefix

Write a program that:

- Takes n strings as input (stored in an array of strings).
- Finds and prints the longest common prefix among all the strings.
- For example, for {"flower", "flow", "flight"}, the output should be "fl".


6. Rotate Array

Write a program that:

- Takes an integer n and an array of n integers as input.
- Asks the user for an integer k (number of positions to rotate).
- Rotates the array to the right by k positions (without using an additional array).
- Example: For array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and k = 2, the result should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].


7. Anagram Checker

Write a program that:

- Takes two strings as input.
- Checks whether the two strings are anagrams (contain the same characters in any order).
- Ignores case and non-letter characters.


8. Subarray with Maximum Sum

Write a program that:

- Takes an integer n as input, followed by n integers to store in an array.
- Implements an algorithm to find the subarray with the maximum sum.
- For example, for the array [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4], the output should be 6 (subarray [4, -1, 2, 1]).


9. String Permutations

Write a program that:

- Takes a string as input.
- Generates and prints all permutations of the string.
- Handles input strings with duplicate characters efficiently, ensuring no repeated permutations.


10. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Write a program that:

- Takes a sorted array of integers as input.
- Removes duplicate elements in place (without using additional space for a new array).
- Returns the length of the array after duplicates are removed and prints the modified array.

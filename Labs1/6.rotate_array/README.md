6. Rotate Array

Write a program that:

- Takes an integer n and an array of n integers as input.
- Asks the user for an integer k (number of positions to rotate).
- Rotates the array to the right by k positions (without using an additional array).
- Example: For array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and k = 2, the result should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].

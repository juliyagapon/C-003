2. Merge Sort with Recursion and Pass by Reference
   Write a recursive function void mergeSort(vector<int> &arr, int left, int right) that:
   - Takes a vector of integers by reference.
   - Sorts the array using the Merge Sort algorithm.
   - Write a helper function void merge(vector<int> &arr, int left, int mid, int right) to merge two halves of the array.
   - Ensure that the array is passed by reference to avoid copying data.
